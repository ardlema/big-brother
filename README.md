Features
========

TODO:

  * Parse user events. The user events will have the following format:
     userId,location
    Where location will be a WKT polygon like this: POLYGON((-3.9968132972717285 40.63518634434282,-3.9978432655334473 40.63451871274505,-3.9962339401245117 40.63422560408105,-3.9968132972717285 40.63518634434282))

  * Identify user dwells. To identify a dwell we should get events with intersected locations during a defined period. The dwell will be the intersection of all these events location

  * Write this dwells to an output file (format??)

  * Visualize the dwells
